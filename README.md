- **Persistent Rules**: Firewall rules persist after application closure

### ‚ö° Smart User Interface
- **Hybrid Table System**: Last 10,000 rows displayed with pending rows system
- **Name Assignment**: Assign custom names to IP addresses
- **Visual Blocking Status**: Color-coded cells show blocked (red) and unblocked (green) IPs
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimal footprint with full functionality accessible via system tray

### üîß Advanced Features
- **CIDR Notation Support**: Import IP ranges using CIDR notation
- **Bulk Operations**: Process large blocklists with optimization
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatic detection and removal of duplicate ranges
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates without interrupting user workflow
